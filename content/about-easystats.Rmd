title: About the Easyverse
---

The Easyverse is comprised of an ecosystem of R packages designed to make the use of advanced statistical techniques easy. The idea is to not only offer a starting place for interacting with and fitting models, but to support any researcher's full project from start to finish, including fitting, interpreting, diagnosing, and visualizing statistical models.

In addition to benefitting from many contributors, our core team includes (often referred to collectively as "easystats"):
